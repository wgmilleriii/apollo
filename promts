what's a good prompt to make a song like this in disney style ? 

Norwegian Black death metal style

Massively Soulful like aretha franklin on deep deep things smoky deep female voice

Solo black deep south male like remember the old days and also o brother where art thou 

Write a soulful, bluesy song about a rescue dog named Apollo, in the style of a solo African American male singer from the Deep South. The tone should evoke the rich storytelling traditions of the blues, gospel, and Southern folk music, as heard in "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" and similar pieces.

The song tells the story of Apollo’s journey: from being a stray on the streets of Albuquerque to finding a loving home and a cushy life. Capture themes of struggle, redemption, and joy, with a sense of warmth and humor. Include vivid imagery of Apollo’s adventures, such as his daily walks, his playful mischief (like sneaking butter from the fridge), and his wagging tail that everyone notices.

The verses should flow like a reflective story, with the chorus serving as a humorous call-and-response where the singer debates with a crowd whether Apollo is a dog or a cow. The music style should feature a slow, rhythmic, and soulful cadence, with lyrical phrasing that feels authentic to the Deep South blues tradition.

Keep the tone heartfelt and nostalgic, blending humor with the deep emotional resonance of a classic blues ballad.
