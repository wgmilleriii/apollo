(Verse 1)
Leash is on, let’s go, it’s time to run,
Big smells, big trees, and the warm, bright sun.
The ground feels soft, the birds all sing,
Tail’s wagging fast, it’s a happy thing!

(Chorus)
(Singer) He's a dog!
(Crowd) He's a cow!
(Singer) No, he's a dog!
(Crowd) He's a cow!
(Singer) Look at his tail, wagging now!
(Crowd) He's a cow, can’t you see somehow?
(Singer) No, he's a dog!
(Crowd) He's a cow!
(Singer) He’s my dog, and he’s here right now!

(Verse 2)
Once on the street, no home, no bed,
Hungry and cold, just a place for my head.
A kind hand came and scooped me away,
Now life is great, it’s a brand-new day!

(Chorus)
(Singer) He's a dog!
(Crowd) He's a cow!
(Singer) No, he's a dog!
(Crowd) He's a cow!
(Singer) Look at his tail, wagging now!
(Crowd) He's a cow, can’t you see somehow?
(Singer) No, he's a dog!
(Crowd) He's a cow!
(Singer) He’s my dog, and he’s here right now!

(Verse 3)
Fridge door opens, it’s butter time,
Sneaking a snack should never be a crime!
With wagging butt and mischief in my eyes,
The humans laugh—they know I’m wise!

(Chorus)
(Singer) He's a dog!
(Crowd) He's a cow!
(Singer) No, he's a dog!
(Crowd) He's a cow!
(Singer) Look at his tail, wagging now!
(Crowd) He's a cow, can’t you see somehow?
(Singer) No, he's a dog!
(Crowd) He's a cow!
(Singer) He’s my dog, and he’s here right now!
